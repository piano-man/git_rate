# git_rate
GitRate is an "extremely" intelligent github profile analyser which provides each of the users repos a rating and also assigns the same for the user.
It is a very powerful tool which can be used by organisations and hackathons alike to shortlist and analyse candidates with the feature to select language preference. .
It will shorten the tedious selection procedure to the mere click of a button.
Sit back,relax and let us do your work for you. :)
