## A smart profile analysis system created during Hack in the North 3.0

### About
GitRate is an "extremely" intelligent github profile analyser which provides each of the users repos a rating and also assigns the same for the user.

Some of the features considered for rating repositories are:-

* Stars

* Watchers

* Number of commits

* Number of contributors

* Number of open issues

* Date the repository was last updated.......

and many more

It also gives each user a percentile score based on the number of users using GitRate and suggestions to improve their rank.

**It is a very powerful tool which can be used by organisations and hackathons alike to shortlist and analyse candidates with the feature to select language preference.**

**It will shorten the tedious selection procedure to the mere click of a button.**

**Sit back,relax and let us do your work for you. :)**
