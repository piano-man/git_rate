# git_rate
GitRate is an "extremely" intelligent github profile analyser which provides each of the users repos a rating and also assigns the same for the user.

Some of the features considered for rating repositories are:-

1)Stars

2)Watchers

3)Number of commits

4)Number of contributors

5)Number of open issues

6)Date the repository was last updated.......

and many more

It is a very powerful tool which can be used by organisations and hackathons alike to shortlist and analyse candidates with the feature to select language preference. .

It will shorten the tedious selection procedure to the mere click of a button.

Sit back,relax and let us do your work for you. :)
